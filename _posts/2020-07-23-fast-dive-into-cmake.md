The finally goal of this blog is to, make you understand which is going on in `CMakeLists.txt`, which I believe everyone has encountered, or will encounter, if one plans to read a big project's source code.

## 0x00 basic

```
pre-compile -> compile(separate compilation) -> assembly -> link
```

In c++, we can do two things:

* Statement, like `void print()`. 
* Definition, like `void print(){std::cout<<"Hi"<<std::endl;}`

The propose of statement is to state a symbol, which can be function, class, structâ€¦, then the symbol will go into the so-called **Symbol-Tabel**. When we compiling, actually we can "skip" the statement like `void print()`, and put it into **Symbol-Tabel**. Then, when we link different source file, we can look for the definition of this statement. For example

```
# a.cpp
void print();

# b.cpp
void print(){
	std::cout<<"Hi"<<std::endl;
}
```

So , in fact, we can run `clang -c a.cpp`, `clang -c b.cpp`  separately(*or `g++` for linux*). And we will get, `a.o`, `b.o`(`.o` stands for object), noting that `a.o` doesn't have any information about the `print` function right now.

In order to create an Executable, we must link them:

```shell
clang a.o b.o -o main
# or
# clang -undefined dynamic_lookup a.o b.o -o main
```

Then, we get what we want. But, A critical problem about the above Statement, it's realy not so automate, let's say, there are more than 100 cpp files `*.cpp` need to state multiple functions `f1`, `f2`, `f3` and stuffs, whose definitions are in `b.cpp`, do we need to add statement on every one of them? That's why we need header,  which just a file can be automatically unfold by compiler.

```
# header.h
void f1();
void f2();
#....
```

And, the familiar macro command `include` shows up. 

>  There are more rules about how to write header, adding `#define` to avoid being included by a file more than once, ...

## 0x01 make

**It's all about automated**

When our C/CPP project grows bigger and bigger, it's low efficient to manually typing `clang` about everything, we need a "robot", and that's `make` and its rule: `makefile`. 

We know that, `pre-compile -> compile(separate compilation) -> assembly -> link` is the process, or to say,`   .cpp -> .o -> binary executable`.    

The finally executable depends on the object file, and the object files depend on the source file, and we can use some certain commands to depict such dependency, for example:

```makefile
add: main.o
    g++ -o add.exe main.o
main.o: main.cpp
    g++ -c -o main.o main.cpp
```

That's `makefile`, always about

1. target
2. prerequisites
3. command

The general form of a `makefile` can be stacked by the block like:

```makefile
target: prerequisites
	command # Tab
	command # Tab
```

If we have a `makefile` under the current folder, we just run `make` to get what we want. (If you have more need about this part, actually there is a website called [makefiletutorial](https://makefiletutorial.com), have fun!)

## 0x02 cmake

*All the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/ttroy50/cmake-examples)*, get your hands dirty.

Soâ€¦, actually `make` is not automated enough, we need a tool to generate `makefile`. ðŸ˜›
